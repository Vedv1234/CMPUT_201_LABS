# CMPUT 201 Lab Assignments

This repository contains lab assignments from my CMPUT 201 course at the University of Alberta. The labs cover fundamental C programming concepts and progress through increasingly complex topics. The early assignments focus on basic calculations and control flow, like an orbital calculator that determines satellite characteristics and a date converter that handles leap year calculations. I also built a retail management system that tracks product sales and generates profit reports with sorted output tables.

The later labs get into more advanced topics like graphics generation, game logic, and data structures. One of the more interesting ones was a fractal generator that creates Mandelbrot and Julia sets as PPM images using complex number arithmetic. I also implemented classic algorithms like Minesweeper board generation and Conway's Game of Life simulation, both of which required working with 2D arrays and pointer arithmetic. The final lab involved building a graph data structure from scratch using linked lists, with operations for adding and removing nodes and edges, plus calculating path weights between nodes.
